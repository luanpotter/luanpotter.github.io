    Hello! My name is Luan Nico, and this is my landing page.
    Please check my <a href="https://github.com/luanpotter">Github Profile</a> for more up-to-date information.

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I'm a Software Craftsman who loves Open Source and the community, currently in love with Dart/Flutter.</p>
    <p>I have worked for more than 10 years professionally and for more years that I can remember as a hobby with a plethora of languages, platforms, and libraries. I like to solve people's problems with technology, and I believe there is always a good solution to every problem and a good problem for every solution; for that reason, I like most programming languages that I have come in contact, and I'm always thrilled to learn something new.</p>
    <p>I also love Physics, and I wanted to learn more about how the Universe works since I was a kid. That's why I took Physics as a graduation course, and my love is divided between Physics and Development.</p>
    <p>I truly believe in Open Source and I try to make, if possible, everything I do open (libre) and free.</p>
