            <p>Hi! This is a comprehensive guide with all information I could gather around how to park near <strong>Benton Street</strong>.</p>

            <p>So let's start with a <strong>map</strong>:</p>

            <p><img src="map.png" /></p>

            <p>As you can see, <strong>0</strong> is your destination. And indeed there are no parking spots on Benton Street right in front of <strong>0</strong>.</p>

            <p>However, there are several options nearby, that I will list below, split into <strong>Street Parking</strong> and <strong>Off-Street Parking</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Street Parking</h2>

            <p>The simplest solution would be to find an available Street Parking. There are several options for allowed street parking nearby, as I will list below.</p>

            <p>Now, of course, each option might be totally full of cars, and therefore, unavailable. As per my inspection there tends to be some open spots on the places I will list, but I can make no guarantee that every single one will be available.</p>

            <p>So to counter that, I am listing a few different options to choose from. I find it very unlikely that all of my options would be 100% full and incapable of holding one more car.</p>

            <p>However, if it does happen, I will provide alternatives after (c.f. Off-Street Parking).</p>

            <p>The closest option would be <strong>1</strong>. Following <strong>down</strong> on Benton Street (or south-west according to Maps) you will find <strong>1</strong>.</p>

            <img src="1-down-benton.jpeg" />

            <p>As you can see in the picture, there are some parked cars, indicating that it's a valid place. Also there is plenty of options to park.</p>

            <p>Moving on if that is unavailable, we have <strong>5</strong>. That would be up Benton and right on Charles.</p>

            <img src="5-charles-right.jpg" />

            <p>As you can see by the photo, there is also plenty of available street parking.</p>

            <p>If that is not an option, we can go to <strong>4</strong>, which is King Street. King Street is a huge street and all along its sides, cars are allowed to park.</p>

            <p>I walk on King Street every day to get to work and every day I notice (1) some parked cars, indicating that is a valid spot and (2) lots of empty space for more cars to park.</p>

            <img src="4-king-street.jpg" />

            <p>Finally, if all that is unavailable, as a last resort, you can try <strong>7</strong>. It looks like a "private parking" but there is no sign forbidding parking, as you can see in the picture.</p>

            <img src="7-near-go-transit.jpg" />

            That place is near the Go Transit terminal, and there are a few options there as well, freely available to taking.

            <h2>Off-Street Parking</h2>

            <p>If that doesn't work, there are plenty of "private/off-street" parking available as well. I understand now, after deepening my investigations, that most have signs forbidding parking there unless some criteria are met. I understand now you cannot use the parking right beside the building, for example (despite the fact that there are always free spots).</p>

            <p>However, there are a few options that have no such signs, or that are more lenient on the conditions.</p>

            <p>Since this a sort of last resort, let's bring out the big guns. Option <strong>2</strong> is a gigantic, multi-store parking facility in which I would bet a lot would <strong>never</strong> not have a single empty space.</p>

            <img src="2-garage-parking-2.jpg" />

            <p>As you can see in the picture, here is the entrance to the dungeon. You might think that it's private, and reserved for unknown ghost cars, but think again!</p>

            <img src="2-garage-parking.jpg" />

            <p>It's freely available through the payment of a very small fee. I would arguee this value is negligible compared to the price I paid you for the service, and I am 100% willing to cover the expenses of parking. You can charge it on my card. It should be less than 10 dollars (probably much less).</p>

            <p>On the line of other paid options, in case that one is full, I present, right across the street, <strong>3</strong>.</p>

            <img src="3-queen-south.jpg" />

            <p>This one is a bit smaller, but is equally very close and another option in case it's cheaper/preferable for some reason.</p>

            <img src="3-queen-south-2.jpg" />

            <p>As you can see in the sign, this one has a different pricing structure. Please not that this one seems to have a max 2h limit (not totally sure what happens after), so that might be something to consider.</p>

            <p>If all else fail, we have also option <strong>6</strong>.</p>

            <img src="6-europro-3.jpg" />

            <p>This is another paid option, but with very accessible prices, as you can see here:</p>

            <img src="6-europro-2.jpg" />

            <p>As I said, I'm willing to pay the full cost of parking if these options are select (confident in the fact you will first try the non-paid options and that, as describe in the messages, it would be a cost of around 5 dollars depending on the choice and time taken to clean up).</p>

            <p>On my queries I also found a few <strong>off-street</strong> parking options that had no sign, meaning to me that they were <strong>not reserved</strong> and also <strong>free</strong>. Of course if you find such option, I encourage you to use it. However I did not include a list as it would take too much work, it would be more likely to be completely full (as they were smaller, and, well, free) and also because I'm not 100% sure on the exact laws on those.</p>
