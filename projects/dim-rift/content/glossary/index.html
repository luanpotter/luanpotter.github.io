Note: greater-than-zero damage can never be reduced to zero or lower due to armor.</p><p><strong>attack</strong>: This can refer to the attack stat or the attack action.</p><p><strong>attack (action)</strong>: An action creatures can take during the Battle Event. See <a href="/projects/dim-rift/content/turn-structure">Turn Structure</a>.</p><p><strong>attack (stat)</strong>: A creature stat represent the amount of damage that creature deals to other creatures on players during their Attack Action.</p><p><strong>counter</strong>: A type of countable marker associated with face-up cards on the field; usually represented by small dice placed on top of the card. cards lose all counters if they leave the field or are no longer face-up.</p><p><strong>damage</strong>: A type of counter placed on creature cards to determine how much of their life has been consumed in the current turn. damage counters are cleared every end of turn.</p><p><strong>destroy</strong>: Move a card from the battlefield into the graveyard.</p><p><strong>draw</strong>: Move the (one) top card of your (main) deck onto your hand. You do not have to reveal it. If your deck is empty, this no-ops.</p><p><strong>flip</strong>: Summoning a currently face-down card on the field. Creatures can only be flipped if they are targeted or attacked. Artifacts can be flipped at any moment at instant speed by their controller. This triggers the cards Flip-type effects.</p><p><strong>life</strong>: The amount of damage counters a creature can sustain before being destroyed.</p><p><strong>mana</strong>: This can refer both to the stat and the resource. the resource can be tied to each face-up card on the battlefield and is used to pay mana costs. Cards collect mana counters according to their mana stat when they are summoned. "Consume X mana" costs can be paid by removing mana from [this]. "Consume any X mana" costs can be paid by removing mana from any card you control. Cards immediately lose all mana when they are no longer face-up on the field. You can use small dice to represent current mana on top of cards.</p><p><strong>movement</strong>: Amount of adjacent horizontal zones a card (typically creatures) can move during the Move Action</p><p><strong>play</strong>: Move a card from your hand or extra-deck onto the battlefield; you can either summon or set the card.</p><p><strong>sac</strong>: Short for sacrifice</p><p><strong>sacrifice</strong>: Destroy a card you control.</p><p><strong>set</strong>: Play a card face-down onto the battlefield from your hand. This does not count as being summoned. Summoning costs are not payed at this point. You cannot play a card face-down from your extra deck. You cannot play Monuments face down.</p><p><strong>stat</strong>: Short for status, it is a numerical value associated with a card that is used for certain game mechanics. Different card types can have different sub-set of stats. The existing stats are: Attack, Life, Armor, Movement and Mana. Each has a unique symbol as per described on the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/content/cards">Cards</a> page.</p><p><strong>summon</strong>: "invoke"/"cast"/"activate" a card face-up onto the battlefield. Done either by playing the card face-up from your hand or extra deck, or by flipping face-up an already played set card. At this point summoning costs must be paid.</p><p><strong>Summoning Token</strong>: A resource players can acquire during Campaign Events that can be used to activate zones they control.</p><p><strong>zone</strong>: Spots on the battlefield in which card(s) can be played.</p></div>
