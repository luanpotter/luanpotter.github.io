        <ul><li><strong>Flip</strong>: When this card is targeted face-down for an effect/attack; immediately before that effect/attack resolves, right after flipping this fac-up: Activate the [Flip] effect. Note: Flip effects happen before any "When summoned" effects. If a creature is flipped back face-down during its Flip effect (e.g. via [Shadowwalker]), it is not considered to have been summoned.</li><li><strong>Poke</strong>: When summoned: flip target.</li><li><strong>Slap</strong>: When summoned: deal 1 damage to target creature.</li><li><strong>Whiff</strong>: When summoned: rotate target.</li><li><strong>Evacuate</strong>: When summoned: move target.</li><li><strong>Protect</strong>: When summoned: target gets +1 Armor until the end of turn.</li><li><strong>Manalock</strong>: When summoned: target card cannot consume its own mana or activate effects that cost mana until the end of turn. If that card has an effect in this chain that would qualify, that effect fizzles.</li><li><strong>Lightfoot</strong>: After [this] takes an Attack Action: [this] can immediately perform a Move Action.</li><li><strong>Vigilant</strong>: After [this] takes a Move Action: [this] can immediately perform an Attack Action.</li><li><strong>Conduit</strong>: A card connected to [this] can use this card's arrows for their targeting.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: When [this] would perform an Attack or Move Action; select an Activation effect from target Artifact: resolve that effect instead. Ignore any costs or slow/OPT restrictions.</li><li><strong>Courier</strong>: When [this] would move from zone A to zone B; you can target one artifact you control from zone A and one empty destination artifact zone you control from zone B: after [this] moves, move the artifact as well.</li><li><strong>Explorer</strong>: This card can move to non-activated zones you control. Note: they do not become active for any other purposes!</li><li><strong>Focused</strong>: [this] cannot block creatures attacking zones other than its own.</li><li><strong>Defender</strong>: This creature cannot declare an Attack Action.</li><li><strong>Evasive</strong>: This creature can only be blocked by the creature in the zone it is attacking.</li><li><strong>Resilient</strong>: When [this] would receive lethal damage: [this] only takes up to its (Life - 1) instead.</li><li><strong>Shadowwalker</strong>: Flip: You can choose another face-down creature you control; flip this back face-down and switch their positions. Note: do not trigger summoning or other Flip effects, nor does it generate mana for [this]. You cannot activate more than one Shadowwalker effect per chain.</li><li><strong>Blessed</strong>: The Blessed effect is active iff a creature you control with at least 1 mana is connected to [this].</li><li><strong>Pray</strong>: When [this] would perform an Attack or Move Action: resolve the following effect instead: "[this] gains 2 mana".</li><li><strong>Transform</strong>: When the transform condition is met, you must immediately sac [this] and you can summon from your XD a [Transformed] creature.</li><li><strong>Prone</strong>: Prone creatures cannot move or rotate during their next Move Action (they must instead spend it to get up). They can still be moved or rotated by effects.</li><li><strong>Transformed</strong>: Can only be summoned using a [Transform] effect.</li><li><strong>Necrotic</strong>: Necrotic damage does not get cleaned-up at the end of turn.</li><li><strong>Sealed</strong>: [this] cannot declare Attack or Move Actions. [this] has [Sealed Sacrifice]. If [this] is destroyed by your opponent: they pay 2 life.</li><li><strong>Sealed Sacrifice</strong>: If [this] would be sac'ed, consume 1 mana: do not destroy [this] instead. That still counts as it having been sac'ed. Each creature can only be sac'ed once for each cost.</li><li><strong>Sacrificial Coin</strong>: A Sacrificial Coin can be spent instead of a generic creature sacrifice to pay for any cost, at any time. It is just a coin you posses, it does not live on the battlefield, and it is not a card.</li><li><strong>Re-target</strong>: When this card is targeted; immediately before that effect/attack resolves: choose a new valid target zone using this card's arrows.</li></ul>
