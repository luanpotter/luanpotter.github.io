<p>At the start of the duel, each player must shuffle their main decks and offer for the opponent to optionally cut.</p>
<p>They also should setup the field and play area accordingly. The 3 central artifact zones on each player's side of the field should be activated using Summoning Tokens from the supply.</p>
<p>Then, players must play Jan-Ken-Pon (rock, paper, scissors) until one player wins; that player immediately picks who is going to start the game. If this not the first game of the match, and the previous duel had a losing player, that player gets to pick instead.</p>
<p>After that, each player will draw 5 cards from their main deck onto their hands (this is their starting hands).</p>
<p>Before the normal flow of rounds start, each player get a special Preparations turn. So the order goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparations Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Preparation Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Preparation Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. The rounds keep on going until the game ends.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-turn" tabindex="-1">Preparation Turn</h2>
<p>A Preparation Turn is a special kind of turn players get before the actual turns start. It's a fair and balanced way for both players to be allowed to set their cards so they can be activated on their opponent's turn (even if they are not the first player). During this special turn, no effects can be activated, no cards can be summoned, and no events can be performed. In short, players are <strong>only</strong> allowed to set cards from their hands. There is also no need for phases in this turn; you do not conduct your draw phase, and you can set your cards in any order. You theoretically can set cards of any type but, of course, at the start of the game, you will only have artifacts zones activated, as you haven't performed any Campaign Events yet. So basically this is a &quot;set artifacts face down on the starting zones&quot; turn.</p>
<h2 id="turn-phases" tabindex="-1">Turn Phases</h2>
<p>Regular (non-preparation) turns are divided into a sequence of phases that must be followed in order (you can skip your Event if you want and then you will have only one uninterrupted Main Phase):</p>
<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/assets/illustrations/turn-structure.svg" width="60%" />
</figure>
<h3 id="start-and-end-phases" tabindex="-1">Start and End Phases</h3>
<p>Nothing special happens in these phases as per the rules, but they exist and must be observed so that effects can resolve during them (if an effect says, at the start of the turn or at the end of the turn, for example). Since they are not the Main Phase, players can only do instant speed actions.</p>
<p>Damage counters from all creatures are cleared at the end of each End Phase.</p>
<h3 id="draw-phase" tabindex="-1">Draw Phase</h3>
<p>During this phase, the turn player must draw one card from their main deck into their hand. This is mandatory, if there are any cards left. Again, only instant speed actions can be performed in this phase.</p>
<h3 id="main-phase" tabindex="-1">Main Phase</h3>
<p>During your main phase, you can perform any slow or instant speed actions. Think of this as the main phase from MTG/Yu-Gi-Oh!.</p>
<h3 id="event" tabindex="-1">Event</h3>
<p>Each turn you can pick one Event to perform that turn. There are 3 to choose:</p>
<h4 id="campaign-event" tabindex="-1">Campaign Event</h4>
<p>This is probably the first event you will do, because at the very first turn you won't have creature zones available to do any Battle, nor enough resources to XD Summon.</p>
<p>The Campaign Event follows this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>the turn player acquires one Summoning Token from the supply</li>
<li>now, in any order they desire, they can:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>consume one of their Summoning Token to activate a zone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>for each face-up card with non-zero Movement (normally creatures): execute the Move Action</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Move Action consists of two interactions that you can do zero, one or two of, in any order, for the card being moved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reposition: consists of moving the card in their horizontal row by the number of zones determined by their Speed status. They can &quot;jump over&quot; other cards like a chess Knight. If you wish to move to a zone occupied by another card, you can &quot;swap them&quot;. The card being swapped doesn't need to have Movement to go the source zone but it is considered to have Moved this turn and cannot move again (you can rotate it as you place it in its zone).</li>
<li>Rotation: consists of rotating the card to a different orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>So on each Move Action you can reposition and rotate, just rotate, etc.</p>
<h4 id="battle-event" tabindex="-1">Battle Event</h4>
<p>During your Battle Event, each of your face-up creatures can perform the Attack Action once.
In the order of your choosing (does not need to be defined in advance), choose one available attacker and declare the Attack Action by targeting a creature zone (can be yours).</p>
<p>Then the Blocker (if any) must be decided; rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the targeted zone has a creature, that creature <em>must</em> block the attack</li>
<li>If not, if the controller of the zone has a creature that can target the zone, he can optionally choose one such creature to block it.</li>
<li>If not, same goes for the opponent.</li>
<li>If not, creature is attacking the controller of the zone directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: normally it is expected that each player attacks the zones of the other player and never block zones of the other player; but the rules allow for more flexibility.</p>
<p>After the blocker (or lack thereof) is established, the Attack Action can be performed.
For blocked attacks, each creature deals damage equal to their Attack stat to the other simultaneously. If at any point the damage counters on a creature equal or exceed their Life stat, they are destroyed. Damage counters are cleaned at the End Phase of each turn. Damage to creatures do not &quot;pierce&quot; (i.e. extra damage does not bleed to the player).
For direct attacks, the creature deals damage to the zone's controller equal to their Attack stat.</p>
<p>You don't need to attack with all or any of your creatures.</p>
<h4 id="xd-summoning-event" tabindex="-1">XD Summoning Event</h4>
<p>If you have enough resources, you can summon really powerful bosses from your extra-deck. During an XD event, you can summon cards from your Extra Deck as if their were on your hand.</p>
<p>You can summon as many as you want (and can afford), one at a time.</p>
