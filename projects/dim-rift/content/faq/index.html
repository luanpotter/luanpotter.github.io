<h3 id="if-a-card-is-destroyed%2C-will-its-effects-resolve%3F" tabindex="-1">If a card is destroyed, will its effects resolve?</h3>
<p>No. Cards must still be on the field at the time of resolution for their effects to resolve. Not only that, but they still need to be connected to the same zones that were targeted at activation. If they were moved or rotated but can still connect to their targets, the effect can resolve.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-target-a-face-down-card%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I target a face-down card?</h3>
<p>Face-down cards are considered cards of their types, because their types are determined by whatever zone they are in. So they can be targeted by any:</p>
<ul>
<li>generic &quot;target card&quot; targets</li>
<li>card-type &quot;target creature/artifact&quot; targets</li>
</ul>
<p>They however do not have any other information (stats, effects, sub-types, etc), thus cannot be targeted by any more specific targeting requirements.</p>
<p>Creatures will necessary be Flipped whenever targeted; artifacts will not (but can be summoned in response).</p>
<p>Note that equipment zone selecting is not considered a targeting action; and face-down creatures do not receive transferred effects from equipments.</p>
<p>Similarly, vehicles can only be crewed or uncrewed to face-up creatures. You must first cause the creature to flip using a targeting effect or attack.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-correct-interaction-between-armor%2C-necrotic-and-resilient-when-dealing-damage%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the correct interaction between Armor, Necrotic and Resilient when dealing damage?</h3>
<p>Armor reduces incoming damage by the armor amount, down to at least 1.</p>
<p>Necrotic damage does not get cleaned up.</p>
<p>Resilient creatures, if dealt lethal damage, only take enough damage to remain with 1 current life.</p>
<p>So if a creature deals 5 Necrotic damage to a 2 Life, 2 Armor, 0 damage creature with Resilient, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The incoming damage (5) is reduced by Armor down to 3</li>
<li>The creature would then take 3 Necrotic damage, but that would be lethal</li>
<li>Due to Resilient, the incoming damage is reduced to 1, as that is the most damage the creature can take without being lethal</li>
<li>The 1 damage that goes through is still Necrotic</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-use-%22heal%22-effects-to-prevent-a-creature-from-dying-from-damage-greater-or-equal-to-its-maximum-life%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I use &quot;heal&quot; effects to prevent a creature from dying from damage greater or equal to its maximum life?</h3>
<p>No. Since destruction is a state-based action, and due to the fact that you can't heal past the creature's max life, there is no moment in which you can activate a heal effect &quot;in between&quot; a creature reaching 0 current life and being destroyed.</p>
<p>If the creature does not have zero damage counters before the lethal blow though, then you can activate in response to remove any prior damage to the creature.</p>
