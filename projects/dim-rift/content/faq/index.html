<p>No. Since destruction is a state-based action, and due to the fact that you can't heal past the creature's max life, there is no moment in which you can activate a heal effect &quot;in between&quot; a creature reaching 0 current life and being destroyed.</p>
<p>If the creature does not have zero damage counters before the lethal blow though, then you can activate in response to remove any prior damage to the creature.</p>

    If anything in the rules wasn't clear, please let me know so I can improve it & add it to the FAQ!
