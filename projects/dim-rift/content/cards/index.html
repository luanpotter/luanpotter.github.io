        <h1 id="cards" tabindex="-1">Cards</h1>
<p>Each card is a rectangular piece of cardboard following the standard MTG size. The backs are all identically non-identifying, except for Extra Deck cards, and the fronts contain a series of common elements and symbols that indicate its characteristics, and texts for the name, type, flavour and effects.</p>
<p>These are the elements specified in each card:</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>flavour text (not available for Alpha)</li>
<li>type: creature, artifact, or monument</li>
<li>subtype (for artifacts): equipment, vehicle, scroll, trap</li>
<li>faction (if aligned): men, fey, telur, wynn</li>
<li>stats: attack, life, armor, movement, mana</li>
<li>effects: one ore more effects</li>
<li>arrows: none, single or double for each direction</li>
</ul>
<p>Cards can be played from your hand onto the battlefield into any eligible zones.
An eligible zone must match the card type (creature, artifact, monument), be on your side of the field, be empty, and be active.
You can play the card face-up or face-down (called set).
If you play it face-up, you must choose an orientation as part of playing, and you must immediately pay the card's cost (if any). If you succeed, the card is summoned (otherwise it is discarded).
If played face down (set), the card is not summoned yet. You do not need to pay any cost.
When a face-down card is flipped, you must immediately summon it, by paying its cost and choosing the orientation. If you fail, the card is discarded instead. If summoned, first an orientation is picked for the face-up position of the card; then their Flip effects activate; Mana is collected, and finally &quot;When summoned&quot;-type effects triggers.
Cards played from your extra deck can only be summoned (i.e. played face-up).</p>

<p>Creatures are the most brittle of cards as they can be easily targeted by your opponent, and can also be attacked and destroyed by damage. However their are the most useful cards for dealing damage to your opponent, and a core component of any deck.</p>
<p>Creature cards played faced down cannot be flipped directly. They automatically flipped at any point if they are targeted (by an attack or effect; by you or your opponent).</p>
<h3 id="artifacts" tabindex="-1">Artifacts</h3>

<p>Artifacts are a bit more protected than creatures because they cannot suffer damage and are a bit harder to target, but still can be destroyed by your opponents effects.</p>
<p>Unlike Spell cards or Instants on other games, and very much like any other card in this game, unless otherwise stated (and except for Traps), Artifacts remain on the field until they are destroyed by some effect; while some artifacts have continuous effects, activation effects or triggers that can happen many times, others have one-of effects and essentially lock your zones, but can be definitely used for sacrifice fodder.</p>
<p>There are a few sub-types of Artifacts with special rules:</p>
<h4 id="equipment" tabindex="-1">Equipment</h4>
<p>Equipments are artifacts that have stats and [equipped]-type effects that can be transferred to a creature.</p>
<p>When an Equipment is summoned, its controller must immediately choose a connected creature zone (i.e. respecting the arrows). However, this does not target the card currently in the zone, and empty or even inactive zones can be chosen.</p>
<p>The [equipped] zone is then established and does not move with creature movement. Any face-up creature, while in that zone, immediately gets all the effects and stats transferred, and similarly, immediately lose them if they leave the zone.</p>
<p>At the end of the equipment's Move Action, or after it is rotated, a different [equipped] zone can be selected (e.g. once per equipment during each Campaign), even if the Equipment card has zero movement or did not reposition nor rotate.</p>
<p>Attack, Life, Armor and Movement stats are transferred to the card currently in the zone, as long as any effects that mention the tag [equipped]. The Movement stat, if present, can also be used the applying the Move action to the artifact itself. The Mana establishes the amount of mana to acquire in the Equipment itself and is not transferred. Attack, Life and Armor specified are only relevant for transferring.</p>
<h4 id="vehicle" tabindex="-1">Vehicle</h4>
<p>Vehicles are artifacts that have stats, arrows and [equipped]-type effects that can be transferred to a creature. They all also have a greater-than-zero Movement stat, and thus can move in the Artifact row. On top of that, as part of their Move Action, they can spend 1 movement point to be &quot;crewed&quot; or &quot;uncrewed&quot;.</p>
<p>To do that, target a face-up creature you control from the vehicle and move the vehicle card underneath the target creature card. Now they are bound together and the creature gets the status and [equipped]-effects transferred, similar to an Equipment.</p>
<p>While crewed, the card is always kept underneath this creature as it moves and is destroyed if the creature is destroyed.</p>
<p>While crewed, Attack, Life, Armor and Movement stats are combined with the creature, alongside effects tagged with [equipped]. The arrows of the vehicle are also added to the creatures arrows (you can choose the vehicle orientation underneath the creature when crewing). Vehicles cannot have Mana.</p>
<p>You can use another 1 movement point to &quot;uncrew&quot; the artifact back to a target empty active artifact zone or the empty active artifact zone immediately &quot;below&quot; the creature.</p>
<h4 id="scroll" tabindex="-1">Scroll</h4>
<p>Scrolls have a powerful, one-off, &quot;When summoned:&quot; trigger-type effect, and then are essentially clutter until they can be destroyed.
They have a special rule regarding their Mana stat: unlike any other card, they do not acquire Mana counters when summoned; in fact their &quot;mana&quot; is considered &quot;spent&quot; when their effect activate. However, they can be sac'ed face-down as part of payment for a mana cost.
Note that if you choose to do that, you can't also use the same Scroll as a artifact or generic card sac cost.</p>
<h4 id="traps" tabindex="-1">Traps</h4>
<p>Traps must first be set and cannot be summoned the turn they are set. You do not need to disclose the that set artifacts are Traps.</p>
<p>Traps have one or more trigger-type effects, and once set, it can only be summoned when one of them would proc. Resolve the one effect being triggered (and only one), and then destroy the Trap.</p>
<h3 id="monuments" tabindex="-1">Monuments</h3>
<figure style="text-align:center;">

</figure>
<p>Monuments are extremely resilient as they cannot be targeted and do not interact with the targeting system. They are rare and you have only one Monument zone, and have effects that normally affect the entire battlefield.</p>
