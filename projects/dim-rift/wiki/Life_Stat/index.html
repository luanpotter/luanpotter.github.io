<h1 id="life-stat" tabindex="-1">Life Stat</h1>
<p>The Life Stat determines how many damage counters a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">creature</a> can sustain before being destroyed. It is essentially the value of the creature maximum life.</p>
<p>It is important to note that creatures do not have a &quot;current life&quot;. The have a number of damage counters and the maximum life. If a creature receives a &quot;+1 Life&quot; bonus, the number of damage counters it has does not change (which means that their effective &quot;current life&quot; does change).</p>
