<h1 id="life-stat" tabindex="-1">Life Stat</h1>
<p>The Life Stat determines how many <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Damage">damage counters</a> a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">creature</a> can sustain before being destroyed. It is essentially the value of the creature maximum life.</p>
<p>It is important to note that creatures do not have a fixed &quot;current life&quot;. The have a fixed number of damage counters and their maximum life, which is just referred to as &quot;Life&quot;. If a creature receives a &quot;+1 Life&quot; bonus, the number of damage counters it has does not change (which means that their effective &quot;current life&quot; increases).</p>
