<h1 id="mana-counter" tabindex="-1">Mana Counter</h1>
<p>Mana Counters are one of two types of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Counter">counters</a> that can be put on top of face-up cards on the field. Mana Counters can be collected on any card type, typically when the card is summoned due to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a>, and can be spent by the card's controller to pay for mana costs. As with other counters, damage counters are persistent as long as the card is face-up on the field.</p>
