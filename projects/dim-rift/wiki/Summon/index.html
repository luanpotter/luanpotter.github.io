<h1 id="summon" tabindex="-1">Summon</h1>
<p>Summoning means to &quot;Invoke&quot;, &quot;Cast&quot; or &quot;Activate&quot; a card, i.e. put it face-up onto the battlefield, from either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from your hand: this is a slow game action that must be done during your Main Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from your extra deck: this is a slow game action that must be done during your <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Rift_Summoning_Event">Rift Summoning Event</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flipping a face-down card already on the field (this can be done at instant speed for <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Artifact">Artifacts</a> and as a consequence of being targeted for <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">Creatures</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a card is summoned, its <strong>Summoning Cost</strong>, if present, must be immediately paid. Failing to pay it will <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Fizzle">fizzle</a> the summon and cause the card to be sent to the graveyard (without triggering &quot;When destroyed&quot; effects).</p>
<p>This is the order of operations to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>reveal the card to both players, and select which zone it will be summoned to (the zone must be valid at this moment, i.e. active, correct type, and empty)</li>
<li>chose the desired orientation</li>
<li>physically position the card on the selected zone in the chosen orientation</li>
<li>collect <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Mana_Counter">Mana Counters</a> on the card if it has any <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge</a></li>
<li>activated any &quot;When summoned&quot; effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the order of operations has a few extra steps in case of a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Flip">Flip summon</a>.</p>
<p>Summoning is the &quot;opposite&quot; of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Set">Set</a>, which means playing a card from your hand face-down.</p>
