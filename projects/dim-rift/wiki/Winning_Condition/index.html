<h1 id="winning-condition" tabindex="-1">Winning Condition</h1>
<p>There is no winning condition on Dimensional Rift - you win when your opponent loses and you don't.</p>
<h3 id="losing-condition" tabindex="-1">Losing Condition</h3>
<p>Any player loses the game if they reach 0 life points.</p>
<p>If the condition happens during the resolution of an effect, the whole effect must be resolved (not other effects in the chain though).</p>
<p>If a player then matches the losing condition, and the other player doesn't, the later wins the duel. If both players lose at the same time, the duel is a draw. (Luan's note: I don't know if this is currently possible).</p>
<p>There are no wining conditions or alternative losing conditions on Dimensional Rift.</p>
<p>You do not lose if you deck out. You are just unable to draw and will quickly run out of resources.</p>
<p>If both players deck out and reach an immutable game state, it is also a draw.</p>
