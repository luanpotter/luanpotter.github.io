<h1 id="move-action" tabindex="-1">Move Action</h1>
<p>The Move Action consists of two interactions that you can do zero, one, or two of, in any order, for the card being moved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reposition: move the card in their horizontal row by the number of zones determined by their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Movement_Stat">Movement Stat</a>. They can &quot;jump over&quot; other cards like a chess Knight. If you wish to move to a zone occupied by another card, you can &quot;swap them&quot;. The card being swapped doesn't need to have enough Movement to go the source zone and is not considered to be taking the Move action (however you can still rotate it as you place it in its zone).</li>
<li>Rotation: rotate the card to a different orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>So on each Move Action, you can reposition and rotate, just reposition, just rotate, or do nothing.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Targeting">targeting</a> is not involved in movement whatsoever.</p>
