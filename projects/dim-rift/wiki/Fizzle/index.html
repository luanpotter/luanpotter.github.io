<h1 id="fizzle-(effect)" tabindex="-1">Fizzle (effect)</h1>
<p>An effect is said to have &quot;fizzled&quot; if its resolution is moot. This can happen mainly either due to missed targeting, or if the card that originated the effect was destroyed.</p>
<p>When an effect targets, it is actually targeting a zone, not the specific card. At the time of activation, the target must satisfy all targeting criteria. However, it must also does so at resolution. If the board changed in a way that a new, valid target is now at the targeted zone, the effect resolves without issues. However, if the zone is no longer a valid target as required by the effect, the effect fizzles. For example, if an effect says <code>target creature</code>, when resolving, there must still be a creature on the selected creature zone. If the zone was left empty, the effect fizzles. If a different creature switched places and is now on the zone, the effect targets that new creature.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the card that originated the effect is destroyed, the effect also fizzles. Cards must be on the field to resolve effects.</p>
<p>Typically, if an effect fizzles, nothing happens at resolution. Resources that were spent are still spent. However, if the effect included a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Soul">Soulrift cost</a>, the player will susceptible to <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Soul">Soulburn</a> damage.</p>
<p>The effect or action is still considered to have been &quot;activated&quot;, so it still satisfies &quot;once per turn&quot; restrictions. If it is an action, the card is considered to have used its action for the turn, even when it fizzles. There is no Attack &quot;replay&quot;. If a blocked attack becomes an unblocked direct attack to a zone, players are no longer allowed to proactively block (passive blocking must always happen).</p>
<p>When cards with costs are summoned, if the player fails to pail the cost, the summon is considered to have fizzled, and the card is sent to the graveyard. &quot;When destroyed&quot; effects are not triggered because the card was never summoned to begin with.</p>
