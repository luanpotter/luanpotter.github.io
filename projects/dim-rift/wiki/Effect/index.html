<h1 id="effect" tabindex="-1">Effect</h1>
<p>Each card in the game has one or more effects listed in their effects box. These effects add to or change how the card or the game behaves, in addition to the normal rules associated with that specific card type (or sub-type). Depending on the type of effect, which is indicated by a symbol on the left of the effect text, they can have varied consequences on the game.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/rules/effects">Rules: Effects</a> for a complete breakdown of the different types of effects and their interactions.</p>
