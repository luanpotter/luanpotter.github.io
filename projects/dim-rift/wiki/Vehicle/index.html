<h1 id="vehicle" tabindex="-1">Vehicle</h1>
<p>Vehicles are a sub-type of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Artifact">artifacts</a>.</p>
<p>Vehicles are artifacts that have stats, arrows and effects that can be <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Transfer">transferred</a> to a creature, similar to Equipments. They also must have a greater-than-zero Movement stat, and thus can move in the Artifact row. On top of that, as part of their Move Action, they can spend 1 movement point to be &quot;crewed&quot; or &quot;uncrewed&quot;.</p>
<p>To do that, target a face-up creature you control from the vehicle and move the vehicle card underneath the target creature card. Now they are bound together and the creature gets the status and [equipped]-effects transferred, similar to an Equipment.</p>
<p>While crewed, the card is always kept underneath this creature as it moves and is destroyed if the creature is destroyed.</p>
<p>While crewed, Attack, Life, Armor and Movement stats are combined with the creature, alongside effects tagged with [equipped]. The arrows of the vehicle are also added to the creatures arrows (you can choose the vehicle orientation underneath the creature when crewing). Whenever a player would Rotate the creature, they can rotate each card independently. Vehicles cannot have Mana.</p>
<p>You can use another 1 movement point to &quot;uncrew&quot; the artifact back to a target empty active artifact zone or the empty active artifact zone immediately &quot;below&quot; the creature (even if not reachable by arrows).</p>
