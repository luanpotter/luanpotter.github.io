<h1 id="creature-token" tabindex="-1">Creature Token</h1>
<p>Creature Tokens are creatures on the battlefield that are not represented by real cards that participate in the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Card_Lifecycle">Card Lifecycle</a>. They are often represented by token cards, which are considered game pieces and can never go into the decks, graveyard, or hands.</p>
<p>Creature Tokens can only exist while on the battlefield and cease to exist when they leave the battlefield (i.e. when they are destroyed). That means they are not put in the graveyard but back into the supply pile where they came from.</p>
<p>Creature Tokens are always 1/1/1 (1 Life, 1 Attack, 1 Movement) creatures with no effect and one single top arrow, no matter how they are represented.</p>
<p>Creature Tokens are ALWAYS summoned face-up in any orientation, but they CAN be put face-down by an effect (there is currently only one effect that can do that, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/cards/card-index/scroll_of_forsaking">Scroll of Forsaking</a>).</p>
