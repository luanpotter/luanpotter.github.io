<h1 id="action-pool" tabindex="-1">Action Pool</h1>
<p>Which possible actions each card can perform is called their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Action_Pool">Action Pool</a>, and is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the actions that are printed on the card</li>
<li>the bonus actions that are granted by the choice of Event (Move or Attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a creature with &quot;Action: Move&quot;, if the player chooses so, can move every Event, no matter which one. But a creature that does not have &quot;Action: Move&quot; only gets access to that action during Campaign Events.</p>
<p>Some creatures have special actions that are described in their card; some have basic actions that are defined in the rules; but the two most basic actions that are part of the game rules are <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Move_Action">Move Action</a> (which is granted by the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Campaign_Event">Campaign Event</a>) and the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Action">Attack Action</a> (which is granted by the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Battle_Event">Battle Event</a>).</p>
