<p>The fey are small, forest-dweller, gnome-like people of small, slim, multi-colored bodies that transform into animals and beasts, adepts of nature-based magic.</p>
<p>They inhabit the forests down south, and exactly how deep into the forest they venture is unknown, but there is definitely a limit, as the deeper you go the denser and more dangerous it becomes.</p>
<p>The Fey cards mostly access the extra deck by the Transform/Transformed keyword, but they still have a few more powerful bosses and monument that are summoned via regular Rift Summoning. On the Main Deck, they have access to a variety of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Scroll">Scrolls</a> that double down as powerful effects or sources of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Hidden_Knowledge">Hidden Knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>Their main mechanics are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Transform">Transform / Transformed</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Prone">Prone</a>.</p>
