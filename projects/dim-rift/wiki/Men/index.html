<p>The men are industrious, city-dwelling and urban; an ambitious people of strength, order and religion, adepts of divine-based magic granted by their one god, Galadon.</p>
<p>They inhabit many cities and towns sprawling the central and north fields of Valtora, and form a kingdom called Altaria. It is surrounded by the lands of the other races below, except for north, where their dominion extends until the ocean.
While human ships might dwell in the few rivers on their land for trade and commerce, few venture to the ocean, and none that has dared to go far has returned.</p>
<p>Human cards access the extra-deck mostly by paying mana to bring out powerful angels and servants of their god. Their Main Deck have a few additional <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Vehicle">Vehicles</a> that can help unlock the full potential of their units, that mix the religious and the military.</p>
<p>Their main mechanics are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Pray">Pray</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Blessed">Blessed</a>.</p>
