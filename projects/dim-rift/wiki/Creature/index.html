<p>Creatures are the most brittle of cards as they can be easily targeted by your opponent, and can also be attacked and destroyed by damage. However, they are the most useful cards for dealing damage to your opponent, and a core component of any deck.</p>
<p>Creature cards played faced down cannot be flipped directly. They are automatically flipped at any point if they are targeted (by an attack or effect; by you or your opponent).</p>
