<p>Artifacts are one of the three possible <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Card_Type">Card Types</a>.</p>

<p>Artifacts are a bit more protected than creatures because they cannot suffer damage and are a bit harder to target, but still can be destroyed by your opponents effects.</p>
<p>Unlike Spell cards or Instants on other games, and very much like any other card in this game, unless otherwise stated (and except for Traps), Artifacts remain on the field until they are destroyed by some effect; while some artifacts have continuous effects, activation effects or triggers that can happen many times, others have one-of effects and essentially lock your zones, but can be definitely used for sacrifice fodder.</p>
<p>There are a few sub-types of Artifacts with special rules:</p>
<h4 id="equipment" tabindex="-1">Equipment</h4>
<p>Equipments are artifacts that have &quot;transferable&quot; stats and effects that can be transferred to a creature. These are denoted by a brown square underneath the effect or status icon:</p>
<p class="center">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/transfer.png">
</p>
<p>When an Equipment is summoned, its controller must immediately select a connected creature zone (i.e. respecting the arrows). However, this does not target the card currently in the zone, and empty or even inactive zones can be chosen.</p>
<p>The [equipped] zone is then established and does not move with creature movement. Any face-up creature, while in that zone, immediately gets all the effects and stats transferred, and similarly, immediately lose them if they leave the zone.</p>
<p>At the end of the equipment's Move Action, or after it is rotated, a different [equipped] zone can be selected (e.g. once per equipment during each Campaign), even if the Equipment card has zero movement or did not reposition nor rotate.</p>
<p>Attack, Life, Armor, and Movement stats are transferred to the card currently in the zone, as long as any effects that mention the tag [equipped]. The Mana establishes the amount of mana to acquire in the Equipment itself and is not transferred. The Attack, Life, and Armor values specified are only relevant for the transferring, unless the artifact is [Autonomous].</p>
<h4 id="vehicle" tabindex="-1">Vehicle</h4>
<p>Vehicles are artifacts that have stats, arrows and effects that can be transferred to a creature, similar to Equipments. They also must have a greater-than-zero Movement stat, and thus can move in the Artifact row. On top of that, as part of their Move Action, they can spend 1 movement point to be &quot;crewed&quot; or &quot;uncrewed&quot;.</p>
<p>To do that, target a face-up creature you control from the vehicle and move the vehicle card underneath the target creature card. Now they are bound together and the creature gets the status and [equipped]-effects transferred, similar to an Equipment.</p>
<p>While crewed, the card is always kept underneath this creature as it moves and is destroyed if the creature is destroyed.</p>
<p>While crewed, Attack, Life, Armor and Movement stats are combined with the creature, alongside effects tagged with [equipped]. The arrows of the vehicle are also added to the creatures arrows (you can choose the vehicle orientation underneath the creature when crewing). Whenever a player would Rotate the creature, they can rotate each card independently. Vehicles cannot have Mana.</p>
<p>You can use another 1 movement point to &quot;uncrew&quot; the artifact back to a target empty active artifact zone or the empty active artifact zone immediately &quot;below&quot; the creature (even if not reachable by arrows).</p>
<h4 id="scroll" tabindex="-1">Scroll</h4>
<p>Scrolls have a powerful, one-off, &quot;When summoned:&quot; trigger-type effect, and then are essentially clutter until they can be destroyed.</p>
<p>They have a special rule regarding their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a>: unlike other cards, they do not acquire Mana counters when summoned; in fact their &quot;mana&quot; is considered &quot;spent&quot; when their effect activate. However, their can still be sac'ed face-down to acquire a discount from <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Hidden_Knowledge">Hidden Knowledge</a>. Do note that, if you choose to do so, you can't also use the same Scroll as a artifact or generic card sac cost.</p>
<h4 id="traps" tabindex="-1">Traps</h4>
<p>Traps must first be set and cannot be summoned the turn they are set. You do not need to disclose the that set artifacts are Traps.</p>
<p>Traps have one or more trigger-type effects, and once set, it can only be summoned when one of them would proc. Resolve the one effect being triggered (and only one), and then destroy the Trap.</p>
<p>Traps have the same special rule as Scrolls regarding their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a>: unlike other cards, they do not acquire Mana counters when summoned; in fact their &quot;mana&quot; is considered &quot;spent&quot; when their effect activate. However, their can still be sac'ed face-down to acquire a discount from <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Hidden_Knowledge">Hidden Knowledge</a>. Do note that, if you choose to do so, you can't also use the same Scroll as a artifact or generic card sac cost.</p>
