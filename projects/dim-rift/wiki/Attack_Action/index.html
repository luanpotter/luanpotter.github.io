<h1 id="attack-action" tabindex="-1">Attack Action</h1>
<p>The Attack Action can only be performed by your <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Face-Up">face-up</a> <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">creatures</a>, and it is declared by targeting a creature zone (other than the one the attacking creature is in).</p>
<p>Then, the Blocker (if any) will be determined; rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the targeted zone has a creature, that creature <em>must</em> block the attack</li>
<li>If not, if the controller of the zone has a creature that can target the zone, he can optionally choose one such creature to block it.</li>
<li>If not, same goes for the opponent.</li>
<li>If not, creature is attacking the controller of the zone directly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: normally it is expected that each player only attack opponent zones, and similarly only block their own zones; but the rules allow for complete flexibility.</p>
<p>After the blocker (or lack thereof) is established, the Attack Action is resolved.</p>
<p>For blocked attacks, both creatures deal <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Damage">damage</a> equal to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Stat">Attack Stat</a> to each other simultaneously. If at any point (as a state-based action) the damage counters on a creature equal or exceed their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Life_Stat">Life Stat</a>, they are destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Damage counters are <strong>NOT</strong> cleared and stay forever.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Damage to creatures does <strong>NOT</strong> &quot;pierce&quot; (i.e. extra damage does not bleed to the player).</p>
<p>For direct attacks, the creature deals damage to the zone's controller equal to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Stat">Attack Stat</a>.</p>
