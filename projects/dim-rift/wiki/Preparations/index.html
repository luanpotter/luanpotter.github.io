<p>Before the normal flow of rounds start, each player get a special Preparations turn. So the order goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparations Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Preparation Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Preparation Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second Round</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>First Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Second Player's Turn</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. The rounds keep on going until <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Winning_Condition">the game ends</a>.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-turn" tabindex="-1">Preparation Turn</h2>
<p>A Preparation Turn is a special kind of turn players get before the actual turns start. It's a fair and balanced way for both players to be allowed to <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Set">set</a> their cards so they can be activated on their opponent's turn (even if they are not the first player). During this special turn, no effects can be activated, no cards can be summoned, and no events can be performed. In short, players are <strong>only</strong> allowed to set cards from their hands. There is also no need for phases in this turn; you do not conduct your draw phase, and you can set your cards in any order. You theoretically can set cards of any type but, of course, at the start of the game, you will only have artifacts zones activated, as you haven't performed any Campaign Events yet. So basically this is a &quot;set artifacts face down on the starting zones&quot; turn.</p>
