<h1 id="transfer" tabindex="-1">Transfer</h1>
<p>Transfer is the name of the process by which some attributes on one card are treated as if they were in another card. This happens with artifacts of types <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Equipment">Equipment</a> and <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Vehicle">Vehicle</a>.</p>
<p>A Transfer effect or stat is not considered to exist on the card it is printed, but it is added to a another card when the Equipment is equipped or the Vehicle is crewed. The card that is being transferred to is referred to as <code>[equipped]</code> on the Transfer card.</p>
<p>Attack, Life and Armor stats on artifacts are typically Transfer, as long as any effects that contain the keyword [equipped]. The Mana stat is never Transfer, and always establishes the amount of mana to acquire in the Equipment itself when summoned. The Movement stat can either mark an artifact that can perform the Move action (if not Transfer) or be a Transfer stat (if so denoted).</p>
<p>Note that artifacts with the keyword <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Autonomous">Autonomous</a> have access to all their Transfer stats and effects even when they are not equipped on crewed.</p>
