<h1 id="counter" tabindex="-1">Counter</h1>
<p>Counters are abstract numbers that are associated with face-up cards on the battlefield. They are typically represented by putting a die with the desired number on top of the card, color-coded to the type of counter.</p>
<p>There are two types of counters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Damage">Damage Counters</a>, that represents damage (combat or effect) sustained by a creature during the game and can lead to its destruction</li>
<li><a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Mana_Counter">Mana Counters</a>, that represent the current amount of mana a card possesses that can be spent by its controller (usually acquired when the card is summoned)</li>
</ul>
<p>All counters are persistent, meaning the stay on the card as it moves around, but cease to exist if the card is no longer face-up on the battlefield. Counters cannot exist on cards anywhere else in the game.</p>
