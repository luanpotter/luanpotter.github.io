<h1 id="rift-summoning-event" tabindex="-1">Rift Summoning Event</h1>
<p>The Rift Summoning Event is one of the types of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Event">Events</a> that you can choose to perform during your turn's Event Phase.</p>
<p>If there are <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Soul">Souls</a> available to Soulrift (either on the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Aether">Aether</a> or on your cards), you can choose to conduct the Rift Summoning Event.</p>
<p>During this event, the player will consume Souls to open a Dimensional Rift, allowing him to summon powerful cards from their Extra Deck.</p>
<p>First, choose the level of Soulrift that you wish to perform (min = 1; max = 3). The number will determine the rank of the cards you can summon.</p>
<p>Then, you can summon as many cards as you wish of that rank or below. For example, of a total of 3 Rank 0 Souls on the Aether, you can elect to Soulrift 2 to open a Rank 2 portal, and then summon any number of Rank 1 or Rank 2 cards from your extra-deck (by paying their costs).</p>
<p>At the end of the Rift Summoning Event, you might need to pay a price. If didn't succeed in summoning at least one card with rank equal to the rank of the portal, you will pay 3 life points per rank missing. For example, if you open a Rift of rank 3 but only managed to summon several rank 1 cards, you will pay 6 life as a cost for your greed. This is the equivalent damage associated with <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Soul">Soulburn</a>.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot summon cards from your hand during this (or any other) event, as Summoning is slow.</p>
