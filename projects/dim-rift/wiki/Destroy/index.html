<p>Destroy is a game action that means sending a card from the battlefield to the graveyard. It can only be done by following a game rule or card effect.</p>
<p>A card must be on the battlefield to be destroyed (see <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Discard">Discard</a> for moving cards from the hand to the graveyard).</p>
<p>When a face-up card that was summoned (i.e. did not <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Fizzle">Fizzle</a>) is destroyed, before it is sent to the graveyard, its &quot;When destroyed&quot; effects are activated, if any.</p>
<p>Destroy is part of the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Card_Lifecycle">Card Lifecycle</a>. Destroying a card you control is referred to as a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>.</p>
