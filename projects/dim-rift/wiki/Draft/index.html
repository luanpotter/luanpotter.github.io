<p class="notice"><mark>WARNING</mark> While the rest of the website is, in general, WIP, the Wiki is particularly incomplete and unfinished. Usage of these pages is not recommended at this stage.</p>

<h1 id="draft" tabindex="-1">Draft</h1>
<p>The Draft is a proposed method to construct the decks each player can then use to duel against each other.</p>
<p>While many different processes can be used, the Draft creates additional layer of deck diversity and strategic competition to the game.  However, it is an involved process that requires some base knowledge of the game to complete. In fact, a recommendation for the first games (until both players are more comfortable with the rules) is to just generate random decks (per faction). Alternatively, more experienced players might also choose to pre-construct their decks from all available Unaligned cards.</p>
<p>If the Draft is the desired procedure to generate the decks, the algorithm below is suggested. That being said, there are endless ways to conduct a fair Draft, and both players can agree on using any algorithm that they desire.</p>
<h2 id="deck-composition" tabindex="-1">Deck Composition</h2>
<p>Regardless of the selected deck-building process, the standard duel of Dimensional Rift has the following deck composition. Each player has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a main deck, composed of 15 cards of their chosen <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Faction">faction</a> + 15 <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Unaligned">Unaligned</a> cards, for a total of 30 cards.</li>
<li>an extra deck, composed of 7 extra-deck cards of their chosen <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Faction">faction</a> + 3 <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Unaligned">Unaligned</a> extra deck cards, for a total of 10 cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even the deck composition can be tweaked by common agreement between players, if a certain aspect of the game is being highlighted.</p>
<h2 id="the-draft-algorithm" tabindex="-1">The Draft Algorithm</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the following algorithm is heavily dependent on the total number and distribution of unaligned cards, and is, therefore, mostly always outdated as I experiment with new cards. You will need to apply some adjustments according to the set of cards you are playing with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following algorithm is a possible fair suggestion for the Draft:</p>
<ul>
<li>each player gets assigned a faction (randomly or by common agreement)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, for the main deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>each player acquires the cards associated with their faction (15 cards)</li>
<li>the 50 unaligned cards are divided into 5 10-card piles</li>
<li>from each 10-card pile each player will select 3 cards, by:</li>
<li>player 2 selects one card and pass the rest to player 1</li>
<li>player 1 selects one card and pass the rest to player 2</li>
<li>and so on until each player picked 3 cards</li>
<li>the rest of this pile is discarded</li>
<li>for the next pile start with the other player</li>
</ul>
<p>And for the extra deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>each player acquires the cards associated with their faction (7 cards)</li>
<li>the 10 unaligned cards are divided into two 5-card piles</li>
<li>each player gets each pile and select 1 card</li>
<li>they then switch piles; now:</li>
<li>each player selects 1 card</li>
<li>each player &quot;vetoes&quot; (discards) 1 card</li>
<li>the remainder of each pile (2 cards each) are shuffled into a new 4-card pile</li>
<li>each player is dealt a random card from those 4</li>
</ul>
