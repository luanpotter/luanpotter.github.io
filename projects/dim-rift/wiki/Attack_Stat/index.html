<h1 id="attack-stat" tabindex="-1">Attack Stat</h1>
<p>The Attack Stat determines how much damage a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">creature</a> deals during combat.</p>
<p>The damage can either be dealt in the form of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Damage_Counters">damage counters</a> to another creature (in case of a blocked attack), or as a damage to the life points of the player that owns the attacked zone (for unblocked attacks).</p>
<p>For more details on which situations damage is dealt based on the Attack Stat, see <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Action">Attack Action</a>.</p>
<p>Note that damage dealt to creatures is reduced by their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Armor_Stat">Armor Stat</a>; and compared against their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Life_Stat">Life Stat</a>.</p>
