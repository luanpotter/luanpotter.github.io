<h1 id="hidden-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Hidden Knowledge</h1>
<p>Hidden Knowledge is a process by which you can sac a face-down card with a non-zero <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a> in order to get a Cost Discount for a cost you are paying (either summoning or activation).</p>
<p>A Cost Discount allows you to modify one number that is expressed as a digit on the cost text by the amount of the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a>.</p>
<p>So for example, if a cost were to say:</p>
<div class="notice">
    Choose any three costs: consume 2 Souls; sac 2 creatures; consume any 2 mana; or discard 2 cards: summon.
</div>
<p>And you sac a face-down card with Knowledge = 1; you can change any of the <code>2</code>s in the cost text to a <code>1</code> (or a <code>3</code>). You <strong>CANNOT</strong> change the <code>any three costs</code> part, because that is not written in numerical form.</p>
<p>Another example: if a cost says &quot;Sac 1 creature&quot;, you can bring that down to zero; but if it says &quot;Sac a creature&quot;, you cannot.</p>
<p>Some other rules and interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only sac for this purpose face-down cards you control with a &gt; 0 <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a></li>
<li>You can only affect costs that you are paying, you must do so at the moment you are about to pay for them, and you must do it after you have already started paying any of the cost</li>
<li>You can reduce or increase a number. You can reduce a number to zero but never below.</li>
<li>The delta change on the number must be &lt;= the value of the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Knowledge_Stat">Knowledge Stat</a></li>
<li>You can sac multiple cards to affect multiple numbers on the cost, but only each number once</li>
<li>You can change numbers associated with mana, material, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Soul">Soul</a>, discard, or life costs.</li>
</ul>
