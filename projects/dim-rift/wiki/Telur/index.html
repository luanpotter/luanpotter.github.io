<p>The telur are half-hobbit/half-dwarf-like people of the hills, of short stature, stout, and with very large hands, very dexterous, and proud of their advanced engineering and magical contraptions.</p>
<p>They inhabit the hills to the west, until before they start to become dunes and end in a deadly desert where none can survive.</p>
<p>The Telur have <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature_Token">Creature Token</a> creation cards and use the extra deck by sacrificing a combination of artifacts and creatures. They are less likely to generate or consume mana (though that ability can be amended to their deck through strategic Draft choices). Their Main Deck is filled with the powerful Artifacts concocted by their engineers, that can be fully unlocked by leveraging their creatures with <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Operate">Operate</a> and <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Maneuver">Maneuver</a>.</p>
<p>Their unique actions are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Operate">Operate</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Maneuver">Maneuver</a>.
Their main mechanics include: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Conduit">Conduit</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Re-target">Re-target</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Manalock">Manalock</a>.</p>
