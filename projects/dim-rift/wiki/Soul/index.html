<h1 id="soul" tabindex="-1">Soul</h1>
<p>A Soul is a shared global resource that is collected whenever creatures perish. Souls can then be consumed by any player to pay for costs on the most nefarious cards, or to perform the forbidden ritual of opening a Dimensional Rift.</p>
<h2 id="collection" tabindex="-1">Collection</h2>
<p>Whenever a card is destroyed, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Creature">Creature</a>; or</li>
<li>it is an <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Artifact">Artifact</a> with <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Autonomous">Autonomous</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Collect one Soul to the shared cache, plus one additional Soul per Rank the card has. So for example, if a Rank 1 creature is destroyed, collect 2 Souls.</p>
<p>Some special effects and abilities, specially from the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Wynn">Wynn</a> (like <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Sealed">Sealed</a>), allow even more Souls to be collected.</p>
<h2 id="consumption" tabindex="-1">Consumption</h2>
<p>Any player can consume Souls from the shared cache to pay for costs as specified in their cards.</p>
<p>Additionally, when performing the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Rift_Summoning_Event">Rift Summoning Event</a>, the player is opting to opening a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Dimensional_Rift">Dimensional Rift</a>, a portal to another dimension that allows certain entities to cross over to our side. To do so, they must consume a number of Souls equal to the Rank of the desired Rift (at least 1).</p>
<p>The rank of the Rift determine the ranks of cards that can be summoned. You can summon as many cards you want whose ranks are equal to the Rift rank or lower. So for example, if you consume 1 Soul, you will open a Rank 1 Rift and can summon as many Rank 1 cards you want. If you consume 2 Souls, you will open a Rank 2 Rift and can summon as many Rank 1 or 2 cards you want, and so on. Note that opening a Rift has a cost (well, on top of having to harvest the souls of the perished): if you don't manage to summon at least one creature with Rank = to the Rift Rank you opened, you take 3 damage per unused rank! So if you open a Rank 3 portal but only manage to summon a Rank 1 creature, you take 6 damage to your life points.</p>
<h2 id="personal-cache" tabindex="-1">Personal Cache</h2>
<p>The <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Wynn">Wynn</a> have certain effects and abilities, particularly <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Reap">Reap</a>, that allow them to separate Souls from the shared cache into their own, personal cache. That means that only that player can access those Souls, but both players can still access whatever is left on the shared cache.</p>
