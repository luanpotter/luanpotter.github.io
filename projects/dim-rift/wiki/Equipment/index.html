<h1 id="equipment" tabindex="-1">Equipment</h1>
<p>Equipments are a sub-type of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Artifact">artifacts</a>.</p>
<p>Equipments are artifacts that have &quot;transferable&quot; stats and effects that can be transferred to a creature. These are denoted by a brown square underneath the effect or status icon:</p>
<p class="center">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/transfer.png">
</p>
<p>When an Equipment is summoned, its controller must immediately select a connected creature zone (i.e. respecting the arrows). However, this does not target the card currently in the zone, and empty or even inactive zones can be chosen.</p>
<p>The [equipped] zone is then established and does not move with creature movement. Any face-up creature, while in that zone, immediately gets all the effects and stats transferred, and similarly, immediately lose them if they leave the zone.</p>
<p>At the end of the equipment's Move Action, or after it is rotated, a different [equipped] zone can be selected (e.g. once per equipment during each Campaign), even if the Equipment card has zero movement or did not reposition nor rotate.</p>
<p>Attack, Life, Armor, and Movement stats are transferred to the card currently in the zone, as long as any effects that mention the tag [equipped]. The Mana establishes the amount of mana to acquire in the Equipment itself and is not transferred. The Attack, Life, and Armor values specified are only relevant for the transferring, unless the artifact is [Autonomous].</p>
