<h1 id="equipment" tabindex="-1">Equipment</h1>
<p>Equipments are a sub-type of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Artifact">artifacts</a>.</p>
<p>Equipments are artifacts that have transferable attributes (stats and effects), called <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Transfer">Transfer</a>, that can be &quot;transferred&quot; to a creature. These are denoted by a beige square underneath the effect or status icon:</p>
<p class="center">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/transfer.png">
</p>
<p>When an Equipment is summoned, its controller must immediately select a connected creature zone (i.e. respecting the arrows). However, this does not target the card currently in the zone, and empty or even inactive zones can be chosen.</p>
<p>The [equipped] zone is then established and does not move with creature movement. Any face-up creature, while in that zone, immediately gets all the effects and stats transferred, and similarly, immediately lose them if they leave the zone.</p>
<p>At the end of the equipment's Move Action, or after it is rotated, a different [equipped] zone can be selected (e.g. once per equipment during each Campaign), even if the Equipment card has zero movement or did not reposition nor rotate.</p>
