<h1 id="graveyard" tabindex="-1">Graveyard</h1>
<p>The Graveyard is a face-up pile of cards each player has, usually positioned above their Main Deck.</p>
<p>It is where cards go once they are no longer in play, either by being <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Destroy">destroyed</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Discard">discarded</a>, or sent there due to failure to <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Summon">summon</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike other TCGs, there are no effects that activate on the graveyard or ways to recurse cards. In essence, it is the final state of any card on a given game. The order of the Graveyard is not relevant but usually is kept in pile order (new cards on top).</p>
<p>Any player can consult any Graveyard at any time for any reason.</p>
