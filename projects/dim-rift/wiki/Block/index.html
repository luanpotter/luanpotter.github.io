<p>Block is a potential part of an <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Action">Attack Action</a> when the attacking creature it is contested by another creature (as opposed to a direct attack).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a creature is attacking a zone which has a creature in it, that creature <em>must</em> block the attack. That can be thought of as a passive block.</li>
<li>if a creature is attacking an empty zone, other creatures can <em>decide</em> to block the attack. That can be thought of as an active block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of type, a contested attack involves one attacking creature and one blocking creature. As per rules of combat, they deal damage to each other simultaneously according to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Attack_Stat">Attack Stat</a>.</p>
<p>Note that face-down creatures cannot actively block. If a zone with a face-down creature is targeted for an attack, that creature will first <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Flip">Flip</a>.</p>
