<p class="notice"><mark>WARNING</mark> While the rest of the website is, in general, WIP, the Wiki is particularly incomplete and unfinished. Usage of these pages is not recommended at this stage.</p>

<h1 id="battlefield" tabindex="-1">Battlefield</h1>
<p>The Battlefield is a set of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Zone">zones</a> that are normally physically co-located on the tabletop in which the game is being played.</p>
<p>Since the exact relative positions between the zones are of paramount important for the game, typically a playmat is used to better delineate the Battlefield.</p>
<p>Cards are played from the hand (or extra deck) to the field. The field is a single place but has two sides, one for each player, which are mirror images from each other. The field is composed by specific zones in which some cards might be able to be played (typically one per zone). Cards must be played on valid zones to be on the field.</p>
<p>Each side of the field consists of two rows of 5 zones on top of each other; the one closer to your opponent contains the creature zones, and the one closer to you has the artifact zones (very similar to a Yu-Gi-Oh! board). There is also an 11th, separated Monument zone for each player, that is on the field but not considered adjacent to anything, and thus cannot be targeted or target anything via arrows. Monuments do not interact with the targeting system.</p>

<p>If you were to compare with an old school Yu-Gi-Oh! board, you can apply the following substitutions to get to a Dimensional Rift battlefield:</p>
<ul>
<li>monster zones ➙ creature zones</li>
<li>spell/trap zones ➙ artifact zones</li>
<li>field zone ➙ monument zone</li>
<li>deck, extra deck and graveyard are the same</li>
<li>there is no banishment in DimRift</li>
</ul>
