<h1 id="campaign-event" tabindex="-1">Campaign Event</h1>
<p>The Campaign Event is one of the types of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Event">Events</a> that you can choose to perform during your turn's Event Phase.</p>
<p>As a bonus for having chosen the Campaign Event, every face-up card with non-zero Movement (normally creatures) gets the <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Move_Action">Move Action</a> added to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Action_Pool">action pool</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of a Campaign Event, the turn player must choose one of their inactive zones to activate.
This is done by putting a <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Summoning_Token">Summoning Token</a> from the supply onto it.
If they already have all 11 Summoning Tokens, they draw a card instead.</p>
<p>Then they can proceed to Actions as normal.</p>
<p>This is probably the first event a player will do, because at the very first turn they won't have creature zones available to do any Battle, nor enough resources to Rift Summon.</p>
