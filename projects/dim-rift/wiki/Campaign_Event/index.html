<h1 id="campaign-event" tabindex="-1">Campaign Event</h1>
<p>The Campaign Event is one of the types of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Event">Events</a> that you can choose to perform during your turn's Event Phase.</p>
<p>As a bonus for having chosen the Campaign Event, every face-up card with non-zero Movement (normally creatures) gets the Move Action added to their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Action_Pool">action pool</a>.</p>
<p>Then Campaign Event follows this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>the turn player acquires one <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Summoning_Token">Summoning Token</a> from the supply</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>if they already have all 11 Summoning Tokens, they can draw a card instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now, in any order they desire, they can (as many times as they want):</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>consume one of their <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Summoning_Token">Summoning Token</a> to activate a zone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>perform their Actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is probably the first event you will do, because at the very first turn you won't have creature zones available to do any Battle, nor enough resources to Rift Summon.</p>
