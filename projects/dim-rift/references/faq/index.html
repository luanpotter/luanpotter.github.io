<h3 id="are-there-any-summon-limits-or-sickness%3F" tabindex="-1">Are there any summon limits or sickness?</h3>
<p>No. Unlike Yu-Gi-Oh!, you can summon or set as many cards as you have the zones available for on each of your turns.</p>
<p>Also, unlike Magic, there is no summoning sickness. Creatures can use Actions immediately after being summoned, during the Event Phase.</p>
<p>However you cannot normally summon creatures during the Event Phase, so typically you are only able to use Actions with creatures summoned on Main Phase 1.</p>
<h3 id="if-a-card-is-destroyed%2C-will-its-effects-resolve%3F" tabindex="-1">If a card is destroyed, will its effects resolve?</h3>
<p>No. Cards must still be on the field at the time of resolution for their effects to resolve. Not only that, but they still need to be connected to the same zones that were targeted at activation. If they were moved or rotated but can still connect to their targets, the effect can resolve.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-target-a-face-down-card%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I target a face-down card?</h3>
<p>Face-down cards are considered cards of their types, because their types are determined by whatever zone they are in. So they can be targeted by any:</p>
<ul>
<li>generic &quot;target card&quot; targets</li>
<li>card-type &quot;target creature/artifact&quot; targets</li>
</ul>
<p>They however do not have any other information (stats, effects, sub-types, etc), thus cannot be targeted by any more specific targeting requirements.</p>
<p>Face-down cards will necessary be flipped whenever targeted; and will be summoned on the spot.</p>
<p>Note that equipment zone selecting is not considered a targeting action; and face-down creatures do not receive transferred effects from equipments.</p>
<p>Similarly, vehicles can only be crewed or uncrewed to face-up creatures. You must first cause the creature to flip using a targeting effect or attack.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-correct-interaction-between-armor-and-resilient-when-dealing-damage%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the correct interaction between Armor and Resilient when dealing damage?</h3>
<p>Armor reduces incoming damage by the armor amount, down to at least 1.</p>
<p>Resilient creatures, if dealt lethal damage, only take enough damage to remain with 1 current life.</p>
<p>So if a 5 damage is dealt to a 2 Life, 2 Armor, 0 damage counters creature with Resilient, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The incoming damage (5) is reduced by Armor down to 3</li>
<li>The creature would then take 3 damage, but that would be lethal</li>
<li>Due to Resilient, the incoming damage is reduced to 1, as that is the most damage the creature can take without being lethal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-use-%22heal%22-effects-to-prevent-a-creature-from-dying-from-damage-greater-or-equal-to-its-maximum-life%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I use &quot;heal&quot; effects to prevent a creature from dying from damage greater or equal to its maximum life?</h3>
<p>No. Since destruction is a state-based action, and due to the fact that you can't heal past the creature's max life, there is no moment in which you can activate a heal effect &quot;in between&quot; a creature reaching 0 current life and being destroyed.</p>
<p>If the creature does not have zero damage counters before the lethal blow though, then you can activate in response to remove any prior damage to the creature.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-go-above-maximum-life%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I go above maximum life?</h3>
<p>Creatures do not have a first-class &quot;current life&quot; - they have their &quot;Life&quot; (max life) and damage counters. So you cannot have negative damage counters on creatures. The creature's &quot;current life&quot; is simply the difference between its Life and its damage counters.</p>
<p>Players, however, just have a current total of life points and do not have a maximum life. They can go above their starting life total.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-target-to-move%3F" tabindex="-1">Do I need to target to move?</h3>
<p>No. Movement does not involve targeting whatsoever. Just choose a zone in the same row your card currently is up to <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Movement_Stat">Movement Stat</a> zones to the left or to the right.</p>
