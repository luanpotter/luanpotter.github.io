<p>The Lore behind Dimensional Rift is especially WIP and completely subject to change.</p>
<h2 id="races-%26-the-world" tabindex="-1">Races &amp; The World</h2>
<p>The world of Valtora is the setting for Dimensional Rift, a relatively small portion of 4 known lands surrounded by wilderness, the ocean, and the unknown. Each is controlled by 4 distinct humanoid races.</p>
<h3 id="men-of-altaria" tabindex="-1">Men of Altaria</h3>
<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/men.png">
</figure>
<p>The men are industrious, city-dwelling and urban; an ambitious people of strength, order and religion, adepts of divine-based magic granted by their one god, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/cards/card-index/avatar_of_the_false_god_galadon">Galadon</a>.</p>
<p>They inhabit many cities and towns sprawling the central and north fields of Valtora, and form a kingdom called Altaria. It is surrounded by the lands of the other races below, except for north, where their dominion extends until the ocean. While human ships might dwell in the few rivers on their land for trade and commerce, few venture to the ocean, and none that has dared to go far has returned.</p>
<p>Human cards access the extra-deck mostly by paying mana to bring out powerful angels and other servants of their god. Their Main Deck have a few additional <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Vehicle">Vehicles</a> that can help unlock the full potential of their units, that mix the clergy and the military.</p>
<p>Their main mechanics are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Pray">Pray</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Blessed">Blessed</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fey" tabindex="-1">Fey</h3>
<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/fey.png">
</figure>
<p>The fey are small, forest-dweller, gnome-like people of small, slim, multi-colored bodies that transform into animals and beasts, adepts of nature-based magic.</p>
<p>They inhabit the forests down south, and exactly how deep into the forest they venture is unknown, but there is definitely a limit, as the deeper you go the denser and more dangerous it becomes.</p>
<p>The Fey cards mostly access the extra deck by the Transform/Transformed keyword, but they still have a few more powerful bosses and monument that are summoned via regular Rift Summoning. On the Main Deck, they have access to a variety of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Scroll">Scrolls</a> that double down as powerful effects or sources of <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Hidden_Knowledge">Hidden Knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>Their main mechanics are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Transform">Transform / Transformed</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Prone">Prone</a>.</p>
<h3 id="telur" tabindex="-1">Telur</h3>
<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/telur.png">
</figure>
<p>The telur are half-hobbit/half-dwarf-like people of the hills, of short stature, stout, and with very large hands, very dexterous and proud of their advanced engineering and magical contraptions.</p>
<p>They inhabit the hills to the west, until before they start to become dunes and end in a deadly desert where none can survive.</p>
<p>The Telur have token creation cards and use the extra deck by sacrificing a combination of artifacts and creatures. They rarely generate or consume mana (though that ability can be amended to their deck through strategic Draft choices). Their Main Deck is filled with the powerful Artifacts concocted by their engineers, that can be fully unlocked by leveraging their creatures with <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Operate">Operate</a> and <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Maneuver">Maneuver</a>.</p>
<p>Their unique actions are: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Operate">Operate</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Maneuver">Maneuver</a>.
Other main mechanics include: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Conduit">Conduit</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Re-target">Re-target</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Manalock">Manalock</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wynn" tabindex="-1">Wynn</h3>
<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img class="game-icon" src="/projects/dim-rift/assets/icons/wynn.png">
</figure>
<p>The Wynn are purple, soft skinned elf-like people, taller and slimmer than humans, that live on the mountain-tops &amp; tunnels, adepts of elemental magic of primal power that comes with an unsettling cost.</p>
<p>They inhabit the mountains and peaks to the east, at least until they become too cold and winter-y.</p>
<p>The Wynn use the extra deck mostly by consuming the Souls of the dead. Their artifacts are primal scrolls and magical equipments. They have mechanisms to facilitate the generation and collection of Souls to help fill their deranged magic.</p>
<p>Their main mechanics include: <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Shadowwalker">Shadowwalker</a>, <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Reap">Reap</a>, and <a href="/projects/dim-rift/wiki/Sealed">Sealed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="world-features" tabindex="-1">World Features</h2>
<h3 id="the-wanderers" tabindex="-1">The Wanderers</h3>
<p>On all 4 lands, enigmatic ruins of an extremely powerful, impossibly ancient civilization can rarely be found, some still inhabited by The Wanderers, which are basically remnants of that people that have achieved immortality and have all their needs satisfied by the endless powerful magic and machinery that surrounds them; they have lost the will to live or do anything, but are unable to die or be harmed in any way by the environment or others, so are left to wander aimlessly until the end of times. Anyone that dares to interact with them trigger their automatic protection systems and find a swift end to their own (non-immortal) existence.</p>
<h3 id="the-malady" tabindex="-1">The Malady</h3>
<p>A plague-like disease that swept through all 4 lands some ages ago, causing much death and pain. Little is known of its causes or why it ended, other than the terrible memories still enshrined on the population and the ever-present fear of its return.
It caused an apparently random member or part of the body (of varying size and shape) of an infected person to characteristically rot, and eventually explode into a black, slimy goo, leading to either death or amputations. After the “explosion”, had the creature survive, it would be immune from future infections.
While all the mechanisms of its spread are unknown, it was clearly contagious, specially through this black goo, but it seemed that even people who had absolutely no contact whatsoever could contract it. In fact it seemed that direct contagion was the less effective of its transmission vectors, specially as the people of all the lands start to adopt more and more aggressive quarantine measures, to little avail.
Renowned mages and scholars of the time spent their lives investigating the Malady, trying to understand its causes, with little-to-no success. It eventually disappear as suddenly as it had appeared, after a few decades of suffering.</p>
<h3 id="the-rifts" tabindex="-1">The Rifts</h3>
<p>Portals to an otherworldly dimension filled with both powerful beings and allies but also chaos and aberrations, that can either happen by accident or be opened by powerful members of any of the races. They can provide immense power, but at a steep cost.
There is some belief that the recent underground proliferation of experiments involving Rift opening has weakened the fabric of reality, making the accidental Rifts to be more common. While the later is definitely demonstrable, it is unclear what if that is a reason, or the only reason.
These portals are where extra deck summoning comes from. When conducting the Rift Summoning event, the player is actually opening a Rift.</p>
<h3 id="wars" tabindex="-1">Wars</h3>
<p>While currently at a (possibly unstable) peace, subsets of the kingdoms have thought with each other over several different wars through the ages, in particular the Humans. In a few instances, all 4 factions have been involved in a few Great Wars.</p>
