        <h1 id="rules" tabindex="-1">Rules</h1>
<p class="notice"><mark>Note</mark> I have not taken care into properly writing and notably structuring these rules. Please forgiven the messy organization.</p>
<p>Flaky Flasks can be played by 2-4 players who compete to see who will be the best potioneer at the end.</p>
<h2 id="objective" tabindex="-1">Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of the game is to have the most Fame at the end of the 12th round.</p>
<p>If tied for fame, coins can be used as a tiebreaker.</p>
<h2 id="contents" tabindex="-1">Contents</h2>
<p>The three main components of Flaky Flasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards - these are ingredients and coins and will be used by players to craft potions. Each player will have a starter deck (Tier 0 cards) and be able to purchase new cards from the Card River as they are unlocked.</li>
<li>Tiles - these are hex pieces the players will use to build their board. Each player start with the singular Tier 0 tile and will be able to purchase new tiles from the Tile Tableau as they are unlocked.</li>
<li>Panels - these represent the chemistry rules of the universe, and define which potions can be made. The Tier 1 rules are pre-determined, and new tiers will also be unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other game elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coins - amount of currency each player has; can be represented by physical coin tokens.</li>
<li>Fame - victory points each player has; players can use dice or pen and paper to represent their current Fame.</li>
<li>Fumes - a shared resource; can be represented by physical tokens; there are light and dark fumes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup" tabindex="-1">Setup</h2>
<p>For the initial setup, give each player:</p>
<ul>
<li>their starting deck (composed of 12 Tier 0 cards, the 9 unique ingredients + 3 Copper Coins)</li>
<li>an empty board and the Tiler 0 tile (a straight 1-pipe piece)</li>
<li>no coins / fame</li>
</ul>
<p>Also setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Chemistry board with the Tier 1 Panels revealed</li>
<li>the Tier 1 Card River</li>
<li>the Tier 1 Tile Tableau</li>
<li>no light nor dark fumes</li>
<li>the Rounds and Turn trackers</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, use a randomized method to determine the first player.</p>
<p>For the following rounds, the next player in turn order will be the first player.</p>
<h2 id="rounds" tabindex="-1">Rounds</h2>
<p>The game is played during 12 rounds, during each of which each player will be able to brew and sell up to two potions in order to acquire coins and fame.</p>
<p>Every set of 4 rounds, a new Tier of cards and tiles is be unlocked; panels are unlocked one by one according to the diagram:</p>
<img src="/projects/flaky-flasks/assets/diagrams/ff-game.svg">
<p>There are 4 tiers of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 0 are the cards and (single) tile on each player's starter deck (there are no Tier 0 Panels).</li>
<li>Tier 1 are available at the start of the game (to purchase, for Cards and Tiles; or to use, for Panels).</li>
<li>Tier 2 are unlocked right after Round 4 (or earlier for Panels).</li>
<li>Tier 3 are unlocked right after Round 8 (or earlier for Panels).</li>
</ul>
<p>Components are unlocked after the end of each round, before the next round starts.</p>
<p>Each round, a turn order is defined by the first player and the clockwise orientation.</p>
<h2 id="round-structure" tabindex="-1">Round Structure</h2>
<p>Each round is a self-contained opportunity for players to play cards, propagate symbols, brew potions and sell them.</p>
<p>Each round is divided into some phases, and contains two Turns:</p>
<img src="/projects/flaky-flasks/assets/diagrams/ff-round.svg">
<ul>
<li>Setup phase: during setup, each player can rearrange their board, and consult their deck before shuffling it.</li>
<li>Turns: then players will play two turns (see Turn below).</li>
<li>Cleanup phase: during cleanup, players will recollect their cards, clear any charges, and clean up any lingering effects.</li>
<li>Market phase: during the market phase, players can take turns making financial transactions (either buying or selling).</li>
<li>Bargain phase: during bargain, players can perform trades or deals with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each phase can either be run simultaneously by all players, or in turn order.</p>
<h3 id="setup-phase" tabindex="-1">Setup Phase</h3>
<p>The setup phase can be run simultaneously by all players, as there is no interaction.</p>
<p>During this phase, players can reposition and rotate tiles on their board to whatever configuration they prefer. They can leave tiles out.</p>
<p>Players can also consult their deck before shuffling it.</p>
<h3 id="cleanup-phase" tabindex="-1">Cleanup Phase</h3>
<p>The cleanup phase can be run simultaneously by all players, as there is no interaction.</p>
<p>Players must:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleanup any charges in their board</li>
<li>discard their coin cards and put coin markers on their temporary wallet</li>
<li>discard any other cards on their field, hand, or deck</li>
<li>recollect their deck from the discard pile</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-phase" tabindex="-1">Market Phase</h3>
<p>During the Market Phase, players will will take turns in turn order to perform financial transactions.</p>
<p>A financial transaction can be either buying or selling something:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a Card from the Card River: to buy a card, a player must pay its coin cost, and then must trash a card in their deck and replace it with the new card.</li>
<li>Buy a Tile from the Tile Tableau: to buy a tile, a player must pay its coin cost (defined on the table below).</li>
<li>Sell a Potion: to sell a potion, a player must first identify the Potion with a Chemistry Panel, and then determine the amount of coins and fame they will receive. If there are multiple applicable rules, the player must at this moment chose which of the rules they will use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you pass, you can no longer partake on the Market Phase.</p>
<p>Once all players pass, proceed to the next phase.</p>
<p>All potions are discarded after the Market Phase, so you cannot keep a potion to sell later.</p>
<h3 id="bargain-phase" tabindex="-1">Bargain Phase</h3>
<p>During the Bargain Phase, players can perform trades or deals with each other.</p>
<p>In turn order, each player can propose any trade or deal with any other player. The other player can accept or refuse the deal.</p>
<p>Players can perform a mutually agreed deal to exchange any combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiles</li>
<li>cards (cards must always be exchanged 1:1)</li>
<li>coins</li>
<li>enforceable deals</li>
</ul>
<p>Players cannot bargain fame.</p>
<p>Once all players had their turn, the round ends.</p>
<h2 id="turn-structure" tabindex="-1">Turn Structure</h2>
<p>Each one of the two turns is divided into steps (some simultaneous, some synchronous):</p>
<img src="/projects/flaky-flasks/assets/diagrams/ff-turn.svg">
<ul>
<li>Draw Phase: each player draws 5 cards from their deck; this step can be done simultaneously.</li>
<li>Ritual Phase: during the Ritual phase, in turn order, players can play any number of Hex effects from their hand, and might play instant speed Counters.</li>
<li>Play Phase: during the Play phase, players will asynchronously play cards from their hand to their board, activating Manifest effects or discard them to activate Charm effects.</li>
<li>Propagate Phase: during the Propagate phase, players will asynchronously propagate symbols on their board.</li>
<li>Brew Phase: during the Brew phase, players will asynchronously brew potions.</li>
<li>Discard Phase: at the end of the turn, players must discard any unused cards from their hand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="potions-%26-symbols" tabindex="-1">Potions &amp; Symbols</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to brew and then sell potions.</p>
<p>A potion is an unordered collection of symbols (at least one) that have been brewed by a player.</p>
<p>It will only be identified with a potion &quot;formula&quot; (chemistry rule) when it is sold, at which time the brewer will acquire a certain amount of coins and fame.</p>
<p>Symbols are the atomic building blocks of potions. They come from <strong>ingredient cards</strong> and are processed and transformed by your <strong>alchemical contraption</strong> (your board of hex tiles) before being added to your Cauldron (this process is called Propagation). Finally, a player might brew a potion with the contents of their cauldron. They must use all symbols currently in their cauldron to brew a potion.</p>
<p>Symbols are atomic and uniquely defined by 3 characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>shape (triangle, square, hexagon)</li>
<li>color (red, blue, green)</li>
<li>value (1 to 12)</li>
</ul>
<p class="notice"><mark>Note</mark> What was originally the "hexagon" symbol I am in the progress of migrating to a "pentagon" instead for a few reasons. The current status of this website is mixed, so please keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Notably important to understand that having two symbols or a symbol of value two is different. For example, you can have 1 <span class="symbol-red">▲2</span> symbol as opposed to 2 <span class="symbol-red">▲1</span> symbols. You can have duplicated symbols in potions.</p>
<h2 id="panels-%26-the-chemistry-board" tabindex="-1">Panels &amp; The Chemistry Board</h2>
<p>The Chemistry board contains the rules of chemistry for this run, i.e. <em>how</em> to make potions.</p>
<p>Each Panel is a particular rule that a potion might follow. When selling a potion, the player can decide which (if more than one) panel/rule they are using, and if their potion is valid under that rule, the rule will determine the amount of coins and fame that the potion can be sold for.</p>
<p>The Chemistry Board has 9 slots for Panels, 3 of each tier.</p>
<p>The Tier 1 Panels are always the same and start unlocked in the board.</p>
<p>The Tier 2 and 3 Panels are unlocked one by one according the round tracker diagram above.</p>
<p>Some symbols are used in Panel cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>▲, ■, and ⬟ are used to represent the three symbol shapes (of any color)</li>
<li><span class="symbol-red">⬤</span>, <span class="symbol-blue">⬤</span>, and <span class="symbol-green">⬤</span> are used to represent the three symbol colors (of any shape)</li>
<li>A combined shape and color can be used, for example, <span class="symbol-red">⬟</span> means a red hexagon</li>
<li>numbers in parenthesis are used to represent symbol values (for example, <code>(1)</code> would mean a 1-valued symbol)</li>
<li>the <code>[#]</code> operator means &quot;amount of symbols (of type)&quot;</li>
<li>the <code>[+]</code> operator means &quot;sum of values of symbols (of type)&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following panel:</p>
<figure>
    <img width="180px" src="/projects/flaky-flasks/assets/panels/even_square_odd_blue.png">
</figure>
<p>Means that a potion qualifies if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has 3 or more symbols;</li>
<li>and all symbols are either:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>square-shaped symbol with a even value;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>or blue-colored symbol with a odd value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So a potion that could qualify for it could be <span class="symbol-red">■2</span> <span class="symbol-blue">▲1</span> <span class="symbol-blue">⬟1</span>, which would be worth 4 coins and 4 fame upon selling.</p>
<h2 id="cards" tabindex="-1">Cards</h2>
<p>Cards can be Ingredients or Coins. They can have Effects. Effects can be one of 5 types:</p>
<p>During the Ritual Phase (these happen synchronously and typically affect other players or shared resources):</p>
<ul>
<li>[Hex]: can be activated by discard the card during the Ritual Phase. Typically they represent an attack or buff that affects you, other players and/or shared resources.</li>
<li>[Counter]: can be played at instant speed during the Ritual Phase to respond to Hex or other Counter effects. Might or might not require discard or another cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the Play Phase (these are done asynchronously by each player separately):</p>
<ul>
<li>[Manifest]: &quot;When played&quot; effects that trigger immediately when the card is played on your board. The card <em>must</em> be played to activate their Manifest effect, but it can be played on a non-connected slot.</li>
<li>[Charm]: &quot;When discarded&quot; effects that you can choose to activate (instead of Playing) from your hand during the Play Phase.</li>
<li>[Trait]: a &quot;continuous&quot; / &quot;passive&quot; trait that an ingredient has.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some effects can <em>exude fumes</em> (either light or dark) or might care about <em>fume dominance</em>. Fumes are two shared global resource, light fumes and dark fumes. At any given time, a certain amount of each fume is present. Cards that exude fumes will increase the amount of fumes of one of the types. At any given time:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there are more light fumes than dark fumes, light fumes are said to dominate.</li>
<li>if there are more dark fumes than light fumes, dark fumes are said to dominate.</li>
<li>if there are no fumes or if there are an equal amount of fumes, there is no active dominance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tiles" tabindex="-1">Tiles</h2>
<p>Tiles are placed on your board and compose your alchemical contraption that allows you to brew potions.</p>
<ul>
<li>power and charges</li>
<li>io bands (symbols, liquids, power)</li>
<li>slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying tiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tile of tier X costs X+1 coins</li>
<li>when you buy a pipe you receive a random pipe piece</li>
<li>the first pipe you buy each round costs 1 less</li>
</ul>
