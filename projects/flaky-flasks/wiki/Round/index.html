  <div>
<h4 id="setup-phase" tabindex="-1">Setup Phase</h4>
<p>The Setup Phase is the first phase of the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Round">Round</a> and can be run simultaneously by all players, as there is no interaction.</p>
<p>During this phase, players can reposition and rotate <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/tiles">Tiles</a> on their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Player_Board">board</a> to whatever configuration they prefer. They can leave tiles out.</p>
<p>Players can also consult their deck before shuffling it.</p>
<h4 id="turn-phase" tabindex="-1">Turn Phase</h4>
<p>See the Turn Structure below.</p>
<h4 id="cleanup-phase" tabindex="-1">Cleanup Phase</h4>
<p>The Cleanup Phase can be run simultaneously by all players, as there is no interaction.</p>
<p>Players must:</p>
<ul>
<li>any temporary effects (i.e. "until end of turn", etc) are cleared</li>
<li>cleanup any <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/charges">Charge</a> in their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/board">Player Board</a></li>
<li>discard their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/coin_cards">Coins</a> and put temporary coin markers on their wallet</li>
<li>discard any other cards on their field, hand, or deck</li>
<li>recollect their deck from the discard pile</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="market-phase" tabindex="-1">Market Phase</h4>
<p>During the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Market_Phase">Market Phase</a>, players will will take turns in turn order to perform financial transactions.</p>
<p>A financial transaction can be either buying or selling something:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell a Potion: to sell a potion, a player must first identify the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Potion">Potion</a> with a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Chemistry_Panel">Panel</a>, and then determine the amount of coins and fame they will receive. If there are multiple applicable rules, the player must at this moment chose which of the rules they will use.</li>
<li>Buy a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Card">Card</a> from the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Card_River">Card River</a>: to buy a card, a player must pay its coin cost, and then has the opportunity of trashing a card in their deck if desired.</li>
<li>Buy a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile">Tile</a> from the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile_Tableau">Tile Tableau</a>: to buy a tile, a player must pay its coin cost (see <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile_Tableau">Purchasing Rules</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you pass, you can no longer partake on this Market Phase.</p>
<p>Once all players pass, proceed to the next phase.</p>
<p>All potions are discarded after the Market Phase, so you cannot keep a potion to sell later.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Market_Phase">Market Phase</a> is completed, players proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Bargain_Phase">Bargain Phase</a>.</p>
<h4 id="bargain-phase" tabindex="-1">Bargain Phase</h4>
<p>During the Bargain Phase, players can perform trades or deals with each other.</p>
<p>In turn order, each player can propose any trade or deal with any other player. The other player can accept or refuse the deal.</p>
<p>Players can perform a mutually agreed deal to exchange any combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile">tiles</a></li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Card">cards</a> (cards must always be exchanged 1:1)</li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Coin">coins</a></li>
<li>enforceable deals</li>
</ul>
<p>Players cannot bargain <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/fame">Fame</a>.</p>
<p>The Bargain Phase only happens before the Tier 3 unlock.</p>
<p>Once all players had their sub-turn, the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Round">Round</a> ends.</p>
