<h1 id="propagate-step" tabindex="-1">Propagate Step</h1>
<p>The Propagate Step is a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a> step that happens right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Play_Step">Play Step</a>.</p>
<p>During this step, players can propagate symbols through their board of ingredients cards that they have slotted.</p>
<p>For each ingredient card in play that the player wishes to propagate, they will process each symbol through their machine following any desired path until they reach their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Cauldron">Cauldron</a>.</p>
<p>Symbols that reach broken paths are voided. Otherwise, symbols cannot be voided and must be propagated all the way (unless a machine voids them).</p>
<p>During propagation symbols can be transformed by the tiles they encounter. For example, a <span class="symbol-green">⬟1</span> symbol passing through a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/tiles/catalyst_injector_r">Catalyst Injector</a> could become a <span class="symbol-green">⬟3</span>.</p>
<p>Players do not need to propagate every ingredient, as they can be saved for the next turn (unless the have the <code>Spoils</code> <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Trait">trait</a>).</p>
<p>After each player no longer wishes to propagate any more cards or symbols, they can proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Brew_Step">Brew Step</a>.</p>
