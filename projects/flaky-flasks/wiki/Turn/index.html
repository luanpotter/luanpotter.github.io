<h1 id="turn" tabindex="-1">Turn</h1>
<p>Each one of the two turns is divided into steps (some are simultaneous, some synchronous):</p>
<img src="/projects/flaky-flasks/assets/diagrams/ff-turn.svg">
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Draw_Step">Draw Step</a>: each player draws 5 cards from their deck.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Step">Ritual Step</a>: in turn order, each player during their turn can, as many times as they wish:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>discard an <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ingredient_Card">Ingredient Card</a> to activate its <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effect;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>after each effect activation, each player has priority (in turn order) to respond with <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Counter">Counter</a> effects from their hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following steps can be done asynchronously by each player if desired:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Play_Step">Play Step</a>: as many times as they wish, players will:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>play cards from their hand to their board, activating <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Manifest">Manifest</a> effects;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>or discard cards from their hand them to activate their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Charm">Charm</a> effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Propagate_Step">Propagate Step</a>: propagate any number of slotted ingredient cards through their board.</li>

<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Discard_Step">Discard Step</a>: at the end of each turn, players must discard all unused cards from their hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only synchronous step is the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Step">Ritual Step</a>; other steps can be performed asynchronously by each player simultaneously.</p>

<h4 id="draw-step" tabindex="-1">Draw Step</h4>
<p>The Draw Step is the first step of the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>.</p>
<p>During the Draw Step, each players draws 5 cards from the top of their deck. That is now their hand.</p>
<p>After all players have drawn their starting hands for the turn, the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Step">Ritual Step</a> immediately begins.</p>
<h4 id="ritual-step" tabindex="-1">Ritual Step</h4>
<p>The Ritual Step is the interactive step of the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>, happening right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Draw_Step">Draw Step</a>.</p>
<p>All effects that affect either other players or the global state of the game (such as <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Fumes">Fumes</a>) will be activated during this step; namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effects</li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Counter">Counter</a> effects</li>
</ul>
<p>During the Ritual Step, players will act in turn order, essentially having a sub-turn; in each player's sub-turn, they can, as many times as they wish, activate a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effect by discarding an <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ingredient_Card">Ingredient Card</a> from their hand that has a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effect.</p>
<p>Before resolving each effect, players get the opportunity to respond or pass priority, again in turn order, starting with the first player after the sub-turn player.</p>
<p>Typically, this process is vastly simplified because not all players will have or wish to use these types of effects every <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>. A simplified version would be each player declaring "no Ritual effects" in turn order, until say one player activates a Hex, and then players can declare responses simultaneously.</p>
<p>After all players had their sub-turn, the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Play_Step">Play Step</a> begins.</p>
<h4 id="play-step" tabindex="-1">Play Step</h4>
<p>The Play Step is a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a> step that happens right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Step">Ritual Step</a>.</p>
<p>During the asynchronous Play Step, players can play cards from their hands in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>play a card (ingredient or coin) into one <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Slot">Slot</a> in their board</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>if the card as a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Manifest">Manifest</a> effect, it triggers immediately and must be resolved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>discard a card with a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Charm">Charm</a>-type effect to immediately resolve its effects</li>
</ul>
<p>After each player is happy with their board state, they can proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Propagate_Step">Propagate Step</a>.</p>
<h4 id="propagate-step" tabindex="-1">Propagate Step</h4>
<p>The Propagate Step is a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a> step that happens right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Play_Step">Play Step</a>.</p>
<p>During this step, players can propagate symbols through their board of ingredients cards that they have slotted.</p>
<p>For each ingredient card in play that the player wishes to propagate, they will process each symbol through their machine following any desired path until they reach their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Cauldron">Cauldron</a>.</p>
<p>Symbols that reach broken paths are voided. Otherwise, symbols cannot be voided and must be propagated all the way (unless a machine voids them).</p>
<p>During propagation symbols can be transformed by the tiles they encounter. For example, a <span class="symbol-green">⬟1</span> symbol passing through a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/tiles/catalyst_injector_r">Catalyst Injector</a> could become a <span class="symbol-green">⬟3</span>.</p>
<p>Players do not need to propagate every ingredient, as they can be saved for the next turn (unless the have the <code>Spoils</code> <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Trait">trait</a>).</p>
<p>After each player no longer wishes to propagate any more cards or symbols, they can proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Brew_Step">Brew Step</a>.</p>
<h4 id="brew-step" tabindex="-1">Brew Step</h4>
<p>The Brew Step is the penultimate step of a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>, happening right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Propagate_Step">Propagate Step</a>.</p>
<p>During this step, each player can decide (or not) to brew one potion with the current contents of their <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Cauldron">Cauldron</a>.</p>
<p>Players cannot pick a subset of symbols. Players cannot brew empty potions.</p>
<p>After each player made their decision, they can proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Discard_Step">Discard Step</a>.</p>
<h4 id="discard-step" tabindex="-1">Discard Step</h4>
<p>The Discard Step is the last step of the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>, right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Brew_Step">Brew Step</a>.</p>
<p>During the Discard Step, each player discards their entire remaining hand.</p>
<p>Players cannot keep cards in their hand between turns.</p>
<p>After the Discard Step is completed, the next phase of the current <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Round">Round</a> begins.</p>
