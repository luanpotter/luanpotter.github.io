<h1 id="symbol" tabindex="-1">Symbol</h1>
<p>Symbols are the atomic building blocks of potions. They come from <strong>ingredient cards</strong> and are processed and transformed by your <strong>alchemical contraption</strong> (your board of hex tiles) before being added to your Cauldron (this process is called Propagation). Finally, a player might brew a potion with the contents of their cauldron. They must use all symbols currently in their cauldron to brew a potion.</p>
<p>Symbols are atomic and uniquely defined by 3 characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>shape (▲, ■, ⬟)</li>
<li>color (<span class="symbol-red">⬤</span>, <span class="symbol-blue">⬤</span>, <span class="symbol-green">⬤</span>)</li>
<li>value (1 to 12, inclusive)</li>
</ul>
<p class="notice"><mark>Note</mark> What was originally the "hexagon" symbol I am in the progress of migrating to a "pentagon" instead for a few reasons. The current status of this website is mixed, so please keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Notably important to understand that having two symbols or a symbol of value two is different. For example, you can have 1 <span class="symbol-red">▲2</span> symbol as opposed to 2 <span class="symbol-red">▲1</span> symbols. You can have duplicated symbols in potions.</p>
