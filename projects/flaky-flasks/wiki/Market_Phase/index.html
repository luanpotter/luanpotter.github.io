<h1 id="market-phase" tabindex="-1">Market Phase</h1>
<p>During the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Market_Phase">Market Phase</a>, players will will take turns in turn order to perform financial transactions.</p>
<p>A financial transaction can be either buying or selling something:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell a Potion: to sell a potion, a player must first identify the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Potion">Potion</a> with a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Panel">Chemistry Panel</a>, and then determine the amount of coins and fame they will receive. If there are multiple applicable rules, the player must at this moment chose which of the rules they will use.</li>
<li>Buy a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Card">Card</a> from the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Card_River">Card River</a>: to buy a card, a player must pay its coin cost, and then must trash a card in their deck and replace it with the new card.</li>
<li>Buy a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile">Tile</a> from the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Tile_Tableau">Tile Tableau</a>: to buy a tile, a player must pay its coin cost (defined on the table below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you pass, you can no longer partake on the Market Phase.</p>
<p>Once all players pass, proceed to the next phase.</p>
<p>All potions are discarded after the Market Phase, so you cannot keep a potion to sell later.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Market_Phase">Market Phase</a> is completed, players proceed to the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Bargain_Phase">Bargain Phase</a>.</p>
