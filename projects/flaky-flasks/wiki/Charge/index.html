<p>A Charge is a resource that is generate onto tiles on your board. It can be generated by charge-generating tiles, such as <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/tiles/tallow_candle">Tallow Candle</a>, or by card effects, such as <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/cards/pyrite_flakes">Pyrite Flakes</a>.</p>
<p>Some machines require charge input to operate (indicated by a green-input IO-band) and others can operate normally but have an special effect when powered (indicated by a green dot below their name).</p>
<p>Charges are often generated during the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Setup_Phase">Setup Phase</a> of each <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Round">Round</a>, and can be moved through pipes and IO Bands during the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Propagate_Step">Propagate Step</a>; they are always cleared up at the end of each <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Round">Round</a>.</p>
