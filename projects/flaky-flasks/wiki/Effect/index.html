<h1 id="effect" tabindex="-1">Effect</h1>
<p>Effect (or card effect) are abilities and extra powers and characteristics that cards can have.</p>
<p>Notably, only <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ingredient_Card">Ingredient Cards</a> have effects.</p>
<p>Effects can be one of 5 types:</p>
<p>During the Ritual Phase (these happen synchronously and typically affect other players or shared resources):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="effect-hex"><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a></span>: can be activated by discard the card during the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Phase">Ritual Phase</a>. Typically they represent an attack or buff that affects you, other players and/or shared resources.</li>
<li><span class="effect-counter"><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Counter">Counter</a></span>: can be played at instant speed during the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ritual_Phase">Ritual Phase</a> to respond to Hex or other Counter effects. Might or might not require discard or another cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the Play Phase (these are done asynchronously by each player separately):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="effect-manifest"><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Manifest">Manifest</a></span>: "When played" effects that trigger immediately when the card is played on your board. The card <em>must</em> be played to activate their Manifest effect, but it can be played on a non-connected slot.</li>
<li><span class="effect-charm"><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Charm">Charm</a></span>: "When discarded" effects that you can choose to activate (instead of Playing) from your hand during the Play Phase.</li>
<li><span class="effect-trait"><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Trait">Trait</a></span>: a "continuous" / "passive" trait that an ingredient has.</li>
</ul>
