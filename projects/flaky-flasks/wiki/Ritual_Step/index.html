<h1 id="ritual-step" tabindex="-1">Ritual Step</h1>
<p>The Ritual Step is the interactive step of the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>, happening right after the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Draw_Step">Draw Step</a>.</p>
<p>All effects that affect either other players or the global state of the game (such as <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Fumes">Fumes</a>) will be activated during this step; namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effects</li>
<li><a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Counter">Counter</a> effects</li>
</ul>
<p>During the Ritual Step, players will act in turn order, essentially having a sub-turn; in each player's sub-turn, they can, as many times as they wish, activate a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effect by discarding an <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Ingredient_Card">Ingredient Card</a> from their hand that has a <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Hex">Hex</a> effect.</p>
<p>Before resolving each effect, players get the opportunity to respond or pass priority, again in turn order, starting with the first player after the sub-turn player.</p>
<p>Typically, this process is vastly simplified because not all players will have or wish to use these types of effects every <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Turn">Turn</a>. A simplified version would be each player declaring "no Ritual effects" in turn order, until say one player activates a Hex, and then players can declare responses simultaneously.</p>
<p>After all players had their sub-turn, the <a href="/projects/flaky-flasks/wiki/Play_Step">Play Step</a> begins.</p>
